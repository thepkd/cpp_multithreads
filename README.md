Multithreading:
- A thread is a unit OS process. 
- An OS process is any program in execution. Another name for a Process is Thread.
- OS needs to keep track of different processes in the system and prioritize one over the other.
- It does this through Concurrency.
- Concurrency: Running different processes at the same time by sharing resources.(Read more about Concurrecy and Context Switching in OS and Computer Organization Text Books) 
- We are also capable of running multiple threads in our program like the OS.
- This is made possible through the std::thread library in C++. Running multiple processes/programs(threads) at the same time is called Multithreading.
